# Design Patterns

This project is a collection of examples to design patterns as outlined in [Head First Design Patterns 1st edition](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124). 

The structure of this project will be that each chapter (design pattern) will have its own folder. While I will focus on providing Python examples, I may also include examples in other languages to extend my own familiarity, such as Go, Rust, or C#. 

Each chapter will have runnable or buildable code files and associated README where I will include my thinking for the solutions I provide. As time permits, I may translate these into accompanying Jupyter notebooks to better organize those thoughts against the code blocks. 

Additionally, I will likely include alternative solutions using a functional programming perspective that solves the same problem--e.g., reactive programming vs observer pattern or closures in place of factories. I leave it to the reader to decide if FP patterns make more sense in these instances. 

To the interested developer, if you would like to contribute to this repo, feel free to submit issues directly in GitHub, comment where appropriate with feedback, or submit pull requests if you have changes. I wecome your support and appreciate you.

Cheers!
